Here is a professional **README.md** for your project:

# 🩸 Cancer LLM – Blood Cancer Prognosis Dataset Builder

This project automatically collects **prognosis, survival, and outcome-related research articles** for major blood cancer types from **PubMed Central (PMC)** and prepares a clean text dataset for **Medical LLM training**.

It downloads full-text XML articles, extracts meaningful content (title, abstract, body), cleans the text, and saves everything into one unified dataset folder.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To build a **large-scale prognosis-focused dataset** covering all major blood cancers for:

* Medical Large Language Model (LLM) training
* Survival prediction research
* Outcome analysis
* Clinical AI development
* Oncology NLP tasks

---

## 🧬 Covered Blood Cancer Types

The script collects articles for:

* Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
* Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
* Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
* Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
* Hodgkin Lymphoma
* Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
* Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
* Follicular Lymphoma
* Multiple Myeloma
* Plasmacytoma
* Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
* Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN)

Each cancer type can collect up to **500 articles** (default), totaling approximately **6,000 research papers**.

---

## 📁 Output Structure

All cleaned text files are saved into:

```
Cancer_LLM_Data/
 └── Blood_Cancer/
      └── Prognosis/
           AML_PMC1234567.txt
           ALL_PMC7654321.txt
           ...
```

Each file contains:

```
TITLE: Article Title

ABSTRACT:
Abstract text...

Main body paragraphs...
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Search Phase

The script searches PubMed Central (PMC) using prognosis-related keywords:

* prognosis / prognostic
* survival / mortality
* outcome / outcomes
* recurrence / relapse
* staging / risk

### 2️⃣ Download Phase

* Fetches full-text XML articles
* Extracts title, abstract, and body paragraphs
* Filters short or low-content articles

### 3️⃣ Cleaning Phase

Removes:

* Reference markers ([1], (2), etc.)
* Figure and table mentions
* URLs
* Extra whitespace

### 4️⃣ Storage Phase

Saves cleaned text into structured `.txt` files.

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

Python version:

```
Python 3.8+
```

---

## 📧 NCBI Requirement

You must provide a valid email for PubMed API access:

```python
Entrez.email = "your_email@example.com"
```

NCBI requires this for responsible API usage.

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

The script respects NCBI limits:

* ~3 requests per second (search)
* 1 second delay between downloads
* Automatic backoff on errors

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python dataset_builder.py
```

You will see progress logs like:

```
🔬 ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML)
Found 1342 papers
Progress: 50/500
...
```

After completion:

```
🎯 TOTAL BLOOD CANCER PROGNOSIS PAPERS: 4821
❌ Failed downloads: 37
✨ Dataset ready for Medical LLM Training!
```

---

## 📊 Dataset Size

If fully collected:

* ~6,000 full-text research articles
* Hundreds of thousands to millions of clinical paragraphs
* Rich prognosis-focused oncology corpus

---

## 🔬 Example Use Cases

* Fine-tuning medical LLMs
* Survival prediction modeling
* Clinical outcome extraction
* Risk stratification research
* Oncology knowledge graph creation

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* This collects **open-access PMC articles only**
* Respect NCBI API usage policies
* For large-scale production use, consider:

  * Local PMC mirror
  * Batch processing
  * Resume checkpoint system

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

* Add resume capability (avoid re-downloading)
* Store metadata (authors, journal, year)
* Convert dataset to JSON format
* Add multiprocessing
* Add automatic train/validation split

---

## 📜 License

Intended for research and educational use.
Ensure compliance with PubMed Central usage policies.
