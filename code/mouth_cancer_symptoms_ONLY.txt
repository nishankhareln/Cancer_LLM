The findings of this study showed that samples had a mean age of 62.6 (SD 12.4) years, an average duration of having diabetes for 4.9 (SD 3.5) years, and high levels of wound severity on average (BWAT=50.8, SD 4.3). This indicates that the majority of the sample were older people, who have a high risk for critical wound severity. First, the factors affecting the wound healing process include infection, high blood sugar levels, and nervous system disorders. This is consistent with the study by Burgess et al [

Symptoms: wound
Information for developing telenursing guidelines was obtained from studying the situations, problems, and needs of patients with diabetic wounds and foot ulcers, as well as from reviewing the existing literature. Based on the information, self-care behaviors are important for promoting wound healing among patients, such as controlling blood sugar levels, taking care of the wound by cleaning and getting wound care regularly and continuously, and eating proper food with good nutrition. According to this study, the patients in the group that received telenursing care could heal wounds in an average of 8.6 (SD 4.3) weeks. The patients in the group that received advanced wound care and normal wound care could heal their wounds in an average of 10.2 weeks. The patients in the group that received wound care every day (conventional wound dressings) and normal wound care could heal in an average of 11.72 weeks. The average cost of wound care for the group receiving telenursing guidelines was 11,772 Baht (US $336.34) per person, receiving advanced wound care and normal care was 14,772 Baht (US $422.06) per person, and receiving wound care and normal care every day was 22,740 Baht (US $649.71) Baht per person. In terms of the average score of satisfaction using telenursing guidelines, it was 4.7 out of 5 (SD 0.2). This is consistent with many studies stating that self-care behaviors, blood sugar level control, and continuous use of medication among patients with diabetes were better after telenursing care [

Dengue severity prediction models are usually developed using hospitalized patient data, but triage and hospital admission are mainly evaluated in outpatient settings. This study developed models using clinical and laboratory data from patients in outpatient settings during the febrile phase. Data from two cohort studies in Vietnam and Thailand were used to develop and validate six models: logistic regression with warning signs, Lasso-selected logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosted classification, support vector machine, and artificial neural network. Models predicted dengue shock syndrome (DSS) as the primary endpoint and moderate plasma leakage and/or DSS as the secondary endpoint. We assessed model performance, discrimination, and calibration, using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Brier score, AUROC, CITL, calibration slope, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. The optimal model was the Lasso-selected logistic regression for predicting DSS and the combined endpoint of moderate plasma leakage and/or DSS (Brier score: 0.044 [95% CI 0.043, 0.044] and 0.104 [95% CI 0.104, 0.105]; AUROC: 0.789 [95% CI 0.787, 0.791] and 0.741 [95% CI 0.740, 0.742]). We identified hematocrit, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and aspartate aminotransferase as predictors for DSS, and abdominal pain or tenderness, vomiting, mucosal bleeding, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum albumin as predictors for the secondary endpoint. Logistic regression and machine learning models using clinical and laboratory data during the febrile phase can support early prediction of severe disease in outpatient settings. Integrating risk prediction models into a decision support system could improve triage and optimize healthcare and resource allocation in endemic and resource-limited areas.

Previous studies have often treated END as a single entity. However, END is more accurately regarded as a clinical syndrome encompassing early neurological worsening owing to diverse underlying mechanisms. Although further studies are needed to identify the key determinants of END and optimize treatment strategies, a mechanism-oriented rather than a uniform management approach should be adopted. Therefore, future studies should stratify END into recurrence- and progression-dominant phenotypes, ideally using prospective clinical and imaging-based designs with serial diffusion, perfusion, or vessel wall imaging. Clinical trials testing individualized treatment strategies, such as intensified antithrombotic regimens for recurrence-dominant END and tailored hemodynamic management, including induced hypertension, for progression-dominant END, are warranted. Currently, no ongoing clinical trials have specifically addressed END using a mechanism-based design that differentiates or simultaneously targets recurrence and progression. Addressing this gap through well-designed prospective and interventional studies may represent a critical step toward the personalized management of END and improved outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, a standardized definition of END that encompasses the progression of a broader range of neurological deficits is needed, as current definitions vary and are largely focused on motor weakness.

We set out to measure the accuracy of EHR nurse documentation during surgery and determine the frequency and variables that contribute to documentation errors. For the purposes of this study, we focused on the simplest charting task: time-stamping. We studied 6 events. The first two (patient in the room and pre-procedure verification) happen prior to the start of the procedure when the patient is awake, and the maximum number of staff are in the room who are frequent multi-tasking. The next two (final timeout and incision) occur at the beginning of the procedure when the patient is asleep and fewer staff are present. Next, final wound closure/completion of procedure occurs typically when staff are completing soft and hard counts of instruments and devices. Finally, there is patient out of the room in which the procedure and all tasks are complete, the patient is on a bed and stable and the only thing to do is leave the OR.

An 82-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, and myalgia. She had a medical history of choledocholithiasis and had undergone endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage with a plastic biliary stent about 3 years ago. She had required hospitalization on 4 occasions over the past 3 months due to recurrent febrile episodes. Although she responded to empirical antibiotic therapy each time, her symptoms recurred after discharge, raising suspicion of a persistent infectious nidus. Blood cultures were obtained during each hospitalization; however, in most instances, including the current admission, empirical antibiotics had already been administered prior to sampling.

A 22-year-old man experienced vision loss in the right eye for 2 h after a wire injury. He had removed the wire himself before presentation, so no IOFB was identified. Ophthalmic examination showed uncorrected visual acuity of 20/400 and intraocular pressure of 3.2 mmHg in the right eye. A full-thickness penetration wound approximately 2 mm in length was visible in the middle of the lower eyelid, with conjunctival and scleral laceration at the corresponding site. The cornea and lens appeared transparent. Traumatic vitreous hemorrhage was present, without obvious abnormalities in the superior retina; choroidal elevation was evident in the inferior and temporal peripheral areas. After emergency admission, the patient underwent initial debridement and suturing under local anesthesia. During the procedure, an 8-mm full-thickness scleral laceration was identified at the inferior corneoscleral limbus, extending approximately 7 mm posteriorly. Routine postoperative treatment was administered to prevent infection, reduce inflammation, and control bleeding, after which the intraocular pressure gradually normalized.

Ten days later, the patient underwent a second procedure consisting of 25-gauge vitrectomy to remove the vitreous hemorrhage and repair retinal damage. After removal of the vitreous hemorrhage, a long chorioretinal wound extending from the inferior posterior pole to the equator was observed, reaching deeply toward the retrobulbar sclera. Hemorrhage and vitreous surrounding the wound were completely removed, whereas hemorrhage within the wound was preserved to provide self-tissue tamponade. Laser photocoagulation was applied around the wound to form a “separation wall,” and the eye was filled with air at the end of the procedure (

A 39-year-old woman presented with 2 years of postprandial vomiting, chest pain, dyspnea, and heartburn. Her medical history revealed self-induced vomiting for weight control that progressed to bulimia nervosa, resulting in weight loss of 44 kg. Initial treatments with proton pump inhibitors provided minimal relief. Comprehensive evaluation revealed type III paraesophageal HH (5 cm hernial orifice), grade 2 reflux esophagitis, anemia, and a gallbladder polyp. The patient underwent laparoscopic cruroplasty with Toupet fundoplication and cholecystectomy, combined with psychiatric management including cognitive-behavioral therapy and fluoxetine.

During clinical history-taking, the patient revealed a long-standing struggle with obesity, which she attributed to her profession as a chef. In an attempt to manage her weight, she had undertaken numerous unsuccessful weight-loss attempts, including dietary restrictions, various diets, exercise, and dietary supplements. On March 2023, due to persistent weight management difficulties, she consulted a gastroenterologist and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which detected reflux esophagitis. Then, the patient admitted that in September 2023 she discovered a method that enabled her to lose 44 kg: self-induced vomiting after every meal. This practice continued for 1 year, leading to the development of bulimia nervosa. Consequently, in addition to significant weight loss, she began to experience involuntary postprandial vomiting. Other distressing symptoms emerged, including chest pain, heartburn, dyspnea, postprandial discomfort, and progressive general weakness. This deteriorating condition prompted the patient to seek medical attention.

As last FELASA Congress's motto, communication still takes a great part in this year's FELASA Congress. There were several presentations on communication. This year's discussion on communication has included both employees from the field of laboratory animal sciences and the public. “Openness” was a point that has been mentioned multiple times. In the presentation “Why Openness Works” by Dr. Stanley and Dr. Addelman, a majority of the public in the UK feels not very well informed about animal research, whereas more than half consider using animals for research acceptable as long as there is no alternative or unnecessary suffering to the animals. It means that better demonstration of scientists’ effort fighting for better medical sciences can raise acceptance and understanding of those who work with laboratory animals. Eventually, the animals themselves can be the beneficiary. The Concordat on Openness on Animal Research was introduced in Hannah Hobson's presentation. The bodies signing the concordat are committed to disclose their status of using animals in research. The public can make informed decision based on the latest information in the concordat annual report. In addition to introducing the concordat, she shared some advice on how to talk about harms. One of them is that it should be admitted that research and testing can bring suffering to animals. This is also stressed by Mary Harvie in her presentation on “Empowering Scientists and Techs to Talk Confidently about Animal Research on Social Media.” She also warned against neglecting animals receiving harm in research. Furthermore, she suggested that people be realistic without using the actual images of animals’ wounds. She also emphasized that we should keep in mind that this is a serious subject, and animals’ sacrifice made for science should not be trivialized. She also gave inspiring notes on conversations and dealing with negativity, which is very common on social media. Perhaps the most valuable take‐home information is that even though negativity is unavoidable in many conversations, abuse should not be accepted, and blocking, deleting people, or even hiding can be helpful.

Nusinersen and risdiplam treatments for type 2 and 3 SMA patients show varied outcomes in managing complications. Scoliosis and hip/knee motion worsened in some patients, while others experienced weight gain and reduced fatigue. Ventilation needs were slightly increased, with occasional use in a few cases and no permanent ventilation required. Where reported, the majority or all patients reported at least one AE.

Studies examining mixed SMA types following nusinersen treatment show varied results in motor function, but overall improvements were generally seen. Worsening was seen in results of SMA complications, with varied results in height, weight and fatigue. Scoliosis worsened in all cases, while ventilation generally improved. The varied results in motor function and SMA complications following nusinersen treatment may be influenced by the mixed severity of the patient group. Patients with later or more severe phenotypes at the time of treatment are less likely to see significant benefits, as the progression of the disease may have already caused substantial impairment. This heterogeneity in patient severity could potentially dilute the overall observed treatment effects, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of nusinersen across different SMA types and stages.

Deep caries was defined as caries reaching the inner quarter of dentine, with a radiographically detectable zone of hard or firm dentine between the lesion and the pulp. Extremely deep caries referred to lesions that penetrated the full thickness of dentine, where pulp exposure was considered unavoidable during operative treatment (Duncan et al.

Unplanned treatments prior to scheduled review appointments, and indicated treatments (e.g., RCT and restoration repair) were recorded as well. Periapical radiographs were taken before and after initial treatment as well as at each review visit using the long cone paralleling technique. The radiographs were evaluated for widened periodontal ligament space or development of periapical radiolucencies at the periradicular region of treated teeth, as well as signs of restoration defects or recurrent caries.

We analysed data from one RCT and six NRSIs on the effectiveness and safety of uterine packing with plain gauze or gauze impregnated with haemostatic agent(s). Although we initially identified 15 eligible studies, six RCTs and one NRSI were excluded because of integrity concerns, and one NRSI was excluded due to critical risk of bias. Estimated blood loss was higher after gauze packing than after balloon tamponade in the included RCT. Low‐certainty evidence from the RCT suggests that compared to balloon tamponade, plain gauze packing might make no difference in the need for additional surgical intervention or blood transfusion. Moderate certainty evidence from the RCT showed that, compared to balloon tamponade, plain gauze packing probably increases postpartum anaemia and maternal fever. From NRSIs, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of uterine packing with plain gauze or gauze impregnated with haemostatic agents on any review outcome.

In this retrospective study, we included patients aged ≥ 18 years who initiated treatment with tofacitinib or upadacitinib for refractory active UC at the Institute of Science Tokyo Hospital between June 2018 and January 2024 and monitored for at least 24 weeks. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of the 2 drugs, comparing them with each other. Based on the abovementioned inclusion criteria, we reviewed electronic medical records and collected data on demographic features, treatment history, disease type, duration, and disease activity, which was assessed by the partial Mayo score (pMS). We also collected laboratory data. Drugs were selected based on shared decision making between the attending physicians and patients. The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission at 24 weeks after initiating upadacitinib or tofacitinib. The secondary outcomes were response and remission rates at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks; changes in clinical disease activity scores and laboratory results; treatment survival at 24 weeks; and safety profiles recorded as adverse events. Patients with a pMS ≤ 2 at induction, missing baseline data, clinical trial cases, who had prior colectomy, and who had initiated the therapy for different indications were excluded. We defined remission as a pMS of ≤ 2 and each subscore of ≤ 1 and 0 points of rectal bleeding, response as pMS reduction of ≥ 2 points and a rectal bleeding reduction of ≥ 1 point or ≤ 1, or remission status. Patients in whom there was no improvement or the disease worsened and who did not meet the above criteria or had their treatments discontinued were considered cases of treatment failure.

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) consist of information provided directly by the patients about their health status including symptom ratings. PROs are commonly used in clinical practice to support clinical decision-making and have recently been incorporated into machine learning models to improve risk prediction. In this work, we aim to evaluate whether the inclusion of a patient stratification based on 12-month post-treatment predicted Patient Reported Outcomes improves risk prediction of radiation-induced toxicity and overall survival for head and neck cancer patients. A bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) recurrent neural network was used to model the longitudinal PRO data and to predict symptom ratings 12 months post-treatment. Patients were stratified using hierarchical clustering over the LSTM-predicted data. A logistic regression model was trained to predict Xerostomia at 12 months and a Cox regression model to predict overall survival. Results show that the inclusion of symptom burden clusters derived from the predicted Patient Reported Outcomes improves radiation-induced toxicity and overall survival prediction for head and neck cancer patients.

A subanalysis was also performed where neonates with UA pH between 7.11 and 7.19 were further stratified into two groups (7.11–7.14 and 7.15–7.19) to determine if mildly acidotic infants at the lower end of the pH range were at increased risk of morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between UA pH and neonatal morbidity.

A 49-year-old male patient with a history of opioid intravenous drug use, inhalational methamphetamine use, tobacco use, and frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners presented to an outside hospital with complaints of discharge from both eyes that initially started in the left eye and progressed to the right. This was accompanied by redness and swelling in both eyes for the past 10 days, he was initially given polytrim drops by an outside urgent care before being seen at the referring hospital. Examination in the emergency room of the referring hospital by a local eye care provider revealed light perception uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) in both eyes. The eyelids exhibited severe edema with profuse purulent discharge. The right cornea showed diffuse thinning and a shallow anterior chamber with lens-cornea touch, while the left cornea was reported as being absent. A CT scan at that time was read as an absence of a crystalline lens in either eye or a collapsed left globe. Cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on fortified vancomycin 2.5% and tobramycin 1.5% topical drops every hour along with topical timolol twice a day. He was started on systemic treatment with intravenous vancomycin 1,250 mg every 8 h, cefepime 2 g every 8 h, and doxycycline 100 mg twice a day. He also underwent a corneal gluing procedure that was delayed until the day after presentation. The corneal gluing in the left was described as covering the left iris and pupil. The gluing on the right was described as being more complicated, with a limbus to limbus descemetocele that ruptured during the procedure, resulting in the entire surface of the cornea being glued.

Symptoms: bleeding
Parasitic leiomyomas are an uncommon subtype of extra-uterine smooth muscle tumors characterized by complete detachment from the uterus and subsequent development of an autonomous vascular supply. Their atypical anatomical locations, independent blood flow, and frequent coexistence with large fibroid uteri make preoperative diagnosis difficult. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is one of the leading indications for hysterectomy worldwide, and leiomyomas remain the most common structural cause within the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) PALM–COEIN classification. Although hysterectomy is considered curative for symptomatic fibroid disease, unexpected intraoperative findings, such as parasitic leiomyomas, can significantly alter operative planning, increase surgical complexity, and necessitate careful dissection to prevent bowel or vascular injury. We report the case of a patient who underwent robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy for symptomatic AUB and a markedly enlarged multi-fibroid uterus. During surgery, a distinct parasitic leiomyoma was discovered, densely adherent to the large intestine with no connection to the uterus. The mass had mesenteric-derived vascularity and required meticulous adhesiolysis for safe mobilization. The uterus and parasitic mass were delivered vaginally. Pathology confirmed benign intramural leiomyomas and separately submitted benign smooth muscle fragments consistent with parasitic leiomyoma. No atypia, necrosis, or abnormal mitotic activity was present. The patient recovered well and reported significant symptom relief at the 1-week postoperative visit. This case shows how difficult it can be to diagnose parasitic leiomyomas and why careful assessment is needed during hysterectomy for large fibroid uteri. We also discuss their causes, imaging challenges, surgical management, and follow-up to help inform clinicians.

A 49-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of progressively worsening abnormal uterine bleeding accompanied by severe dysmenorrhea and symptomatic anemia. Her menstrual cycles were regular every 28–30 days but had become increasingly heavy, requiring 10–12 tampons or maxi pads daily with frequent passage of large clots. Associated symptoms included fatigue, exertional dyspnea, dizziness, pelvic pressure, early satiety, intermittent constipation, and urinary frequency. Her medical history was notable for stage III chronic kidney disease, recurrent deep vein thromboses, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic iron-deficiency anemia, gastroparesis, and longstanding uterine leiomyomas. Past surgical history included gastric bypass, bilateral tubal ligation, appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and abdominal hernia repair. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use. There was no personal or family history of gynecologic malignancy, and cervical cancer screening was up to date. Physical examination revealed an enlarged, anteriorly positioned uterus consistent with a fibroid uterus. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated chronic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and ferritin of 15.3 ng/mL. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed a markedly enlarged uterus measuring 17.2 × 8.9 × 12.0 cm with multiple intramural and subserosal leiomyomas. Both ovaries appeared normal with preserved Doppler flow. Endometrial biopsy demonstrated disordered proliferative endometrium without hyperplasia or malignancy. Given the patient’s significant symptom burden, chronic anemia, large multi-fibroid uterus, and failure of medical management, she elected to proceed with robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy.

Context 145 (PMC:12884688) - 1 symptoms:
Symptoms: nodule
Pulmonary sequestration (PS) is a rare congenital foregut abnormality characterized by non-functioning lung tissue that receives an arterial blood supply from an anomalous systemic artery, typically the aorta, and is separated from the normal tracheobronchial tree. It often presents as a mass-like, cystic, cavitary or pneumonic lesion on imaging. Patients often present with symptoms of recurrent pulmonary infection; however, cryptococcal infection is rare. The present case study reports on a 52-year-old man with PS and cryptococcal infection. The mass in the lower lobe of the right lung was removed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and diagnosed as PS. Furthermore, the nodule present in the left inferior lobe was identified as cryptococcal infection by percutaneous lung biopsy. Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) disappeared after antifungal treatment. During the 3-year follow-up, the patient was in good condition and no recurrence of either disease was observed on contrast-enhanced CT. The present unique case of intralobar PS with a contralateral PC nodule underscores that in the absence of a classic systemic feeding artery on imaging, percutaneous biopsy is a key step in diagnosing PS and excluding malignancy. This demonstrates the necessity for anatomy-driven management strategies, whereby spatially separated pathologies warrant a combined approach of surgical resection for the PS and targeted antifungal therapy for the PC. The definitive exclusion of cryptococcal infection within the resected PS tissue argues for a coincidental coexistence in this immunocompetent host, highlighting the importance of evaluating each lesion independently rather than seeking a unifying diagnosis in complex pulmonary presentations.

Symptoms: hemorrhage
At two weeks after admission, the patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery resection of PS. Notably, the decision to perform a lobectomy, rather than a more limited resection, was based on intraoperative findings and surgical principles for PS, namely the sequestered lung tissue was diffusely abnormal and involved multiple segments of the lower lobe. Furthermore, the risk of injury to the often large, friable and anomalous systemic vessels was deemed higher with a sublobar resection, making lobectomy the safer and more definitive procedure. Intraoperatively, careful dissection along the inferior pulmonary ligament and the posteromedial aspect of the lesion revealed a single aberrant systemic feeding artery. This vessel, ~6 mm in diameter, originated directly from the descending thoracic aorta. It was meticulously isolated, doubly ligated with non-absorbable suture and then divided prior to parenchymal dissection. Securing this anomalous vessel was a step prioritized to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage. Macroscopically, the resected lower lobe of the right lung was 17x11x3 cm and a capsule with a size of 3.5x3x1.5 cm was observed in the section 3.5 cm from the broken end of the bronchus (the contents had been lost;
