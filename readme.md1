Yes Nishan — **you absolutely can build your own tokenizer**, but whether you *should* depends on your training strategy.

Since you're working toward **Cancer LLM / biomedical modeling**, let's break this down clearly and practically.

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Should You Create Your Own Tokenizer?

## ✅ When You SHOULD create a custom tokenizer

Create one if:

* You are **training a model from scratch**
* You want **domain-specific vocabulary** (e.g., BRCA2, PSA, PI-RADS, Gleason, chemoprevention)
* You are building a **full custom LLM**
* You want optimal compression for biomedical text

## ❌ When You SHOULD NOT

If you're:

* Fine-tuning **Google AI**’s BioBERT
* Fine-tuning **Google AI**’s BERT-based biomedical models
* Using **Hugging Face** pretrained transformers

Then:

👉 **Do NOT change the tokenizer**
Because tokenizer and model vocabulary must match.

---

# 🧬 2️⃣ For BioBERT – What Should You Do?

If you're using:

### 📌 BioBERT

BioBERT is based on BERT → uses **WordPiece tokenizer**

You must:

* Use the original tokenizer
* Format your dataset correctly
* Not retrain tokenizer unless training from scratch

---

# 🧪 3️⃣ Your Case (Cancer Prevention Dataset)

You currently have:

* Text format
* JSON format
* Topic-tagged contexts
* Structured prevention metadata

### 🔥 Best Strategy For You:

### Option A — Fine-tune BioBERT (Recommended for Now)

1. Keep original tokenizer
2. Convert dataset into:

   * Classification format
   * NER format
   * QA format
3. Use HuggingFace Trainer

This is fastest and most stable.

---

### Option B — Train Your Own Biomedical LLM (Advanced)

Then yes, build your own tokenizer:

Use:

* SentencePiece (Unigram or BPE)
* Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
* WordPiece

Preferred for biomedical:
👉 SentencePiece Unigram

Why?

* Handles rare medical terms better
* Works well for domain-specific corpora

---

# 🏗️ 4️⃣ If You Build Custom Tokenizer – Workflow

### Step 1: Merge all text

Combine:

* All paragraphs
* All prevention descriptions
* Topic metadata (optional)

### Step 2: Train tokenizer

Choose vocab size:

* 30k (BERT style)
* 50k (more domain coverage)

### Step 3: Train model from scratch

Using:

* Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
* Or Causal LM if GPT-style

---

# ⚠️ Important Technical Warning

If you:

* Change tokenizer
* But keep BioBERT weights

❌ It will break the model.

Because:

* Embedding layer size changes
* Token IDs mismatch

Tokenizer and model must be aligned.

## 🧠 Tokenization Strategy

This project supports two training approaches:

### 🔹 Fine-Tuning Existing Biomedical Models (Recommended)

For BioBERT-based training:

* The original WordPiece tokenizer is preserved.
* No custom tokenizer is used.
* Dataset is formatted for:

  * Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
  * Classification
  * Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  * Question Answering (QA)

This ensures compatibility with pretrained weights.

---

### 🔹 Training a Custom Biomedical LLM

If training from scratch:

* A domain-specific tokenizer can be trained using SentencePiece.
* Recommended vocabulary size: 30,000–50,000 tokens.
* Corpus includes:

  * Prevention paragraphs
  * Structured topic metadata
  * Screening guidelines
  * Genetic risk information

This improves coverage of biomedical terminology such as:
BRCA2, PSA, PI-RADS, chemoprevention, multiparametric MRI, etc.

# 🧠 My Recommendation For You (Based on Your Skill Level & Goal)

Since you're:

* Building Cancer LLM
* Working with PMC extraction
* Planning structured prevention datasets

👉 Phase 1: Fine-tune BioBERT
👉 Phase 2: Build custom tokenizer
👉 Phase 3: Train domain LLM

Progressive approach.

# 🚀 If You Want Next-Level Advice

Tell me:

* Are you doing classification?
* QA system?
* Full LLM?
* RAG pipeline?
* Or foundation model training?

Then I’ll design the full training pipeline for your Cancer LLM project.
